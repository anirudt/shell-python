## What?
This is an experimental shell implemented in Python.

## Features
- Directory wise history mapping: This feature uses ``` readline ``` APIs to fulfil directory level history caching, which can be accessed by the overridden Ctrl+R reverse search key.
- All utilities from /bin, /usr/bin usable.

## Utilities
```
cd
pwd
exit
```

## Outsourcable utilities
```
All executables in /bin and /usr/bin.
```

You can add entities to either list by editing the dicts/lists.


## TODO:
- Second level autocomplete-tabbing does not work.
